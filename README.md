# Real-Time-Social-Media-Analytics-Platform

This is for my reference.

## Steps taken so far

1. Created a virtual environment named "analytics-env" with `python -m venv analytics-env`. After creating the virtual environment, run `analytics-venv\Scripts\activate` to activate. Run `deactivate` to deactivate after the project is done.

2. Installed `confluent-kafka`, `kafka-python`, and `faker` in this virtual environment.

3. Created a requirements text file with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. If we want to recreate this environment on another system, we can do so by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
